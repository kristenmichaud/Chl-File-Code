# Chl-File-Code

Code to produce the output file "chl_seasonal.csv" can be found within this repository. 

Benthic sampling locations (lat and long) are publicly available from SBC LTER:
Santa Barbara Coastal LTER, D. Reed, and R. Miller. 2021. SBC LTER: Reef: Kelp Forest Community Dynamics: Transect depth data ver 7. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/c4f5b56d546309d0fa1d52a61bfb42d4 (Accessed 2022-09-27).

All chlorophyll-a raster files were downloaded from https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/10.5067/AQUA/MODIS/L3M/CHL/2018/

NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Ocean Ecology Laboratory, Ocean Biology Processing Group. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua Chlorophyll Data; 2018 Reprocessing. NASA OB.DAAC, Greenbelt, MD, USA. doi: 10.5067/AQUA/MODIS/L3M/CHL/2018.Accessed on 07/20/2022

Files were binned by month in 4km bins and downloaded separately to produce a file with the average seasonal chl-a concentration at each site. Seasons correspond to the seasonal sampling schedule of the SBC LTER.
